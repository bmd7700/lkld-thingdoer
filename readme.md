The Lakeland Thing-Doer is a page designed to help people find an activity to do in Lakeland.

It is a simple page with a banner bar and five buttons.

1: Random Experience. Selects a random experience from a random category.
2: Food. - break out into breakfast, lunch, dinner
3: Parks.
4: Activities.
5: Shopping.

Each button causes the page to randomly select an activity from the appropriate array. The result is then displayed below the buttons.

**IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**

1. Expand the selection of arrays.
   a. Break 'Foods' out into breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner.
   b. Add a category for bars.
   c. Add a category for coffee shops.

2. Aesthetic improvements.
   a. Make a better header. Site title in the top-center, banner bar below.
   i. Banner bar could include local weather maybe through an API.
   b. Background image. Find a creative commons image or use one of my own.
   c. Color scheme.

3. Functional improvement: figure out how to make the result more attention-getting or aesthetic.
   a. Convert the arrays to an array of objects; objects should then populate fields in the HTML with relevant information.
