The Lakeland Thing-Doer is a page designed to help people find an activity to do in Lakeland.

It is a simple page with a banner bar and five buttons.

1: Random Experience. Selects a random experience from a random category.
2: Food.
3: Parks.
4: Activities.
5: Shopping.

On click, each button should alert the user to the winning selection.

Eventually, we can have the buttons open a page with detailed information about each option.

Phase II: add bars and beer halls, segregate food by category, combine parks and activities into one category
each category contains an array of endpoints. For now, just strings. Phase II: make it return objects with phone, address, etc etc.
